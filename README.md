# Unity Component Save System
Save system that is developed to co-exist with the current component system of Unity.


```csharp
using Lowscope.Saving;
using UnityEngine;

public class ExampleScript : MonoBehaviour, ISaveable
{
    [System.Serializable]
    public class Stats
    {
        public string Name;
        public int Experience;
        public int Health;
    }

    private Stats stats;

    // Gets synced from the SaveMaster
    public void OnLoad(string data)
    {
        stats = JsonUtility.FromJson<Stats>(data);
    }

    // Send data to the Saveable component, then into the SaveGame (On request of the save master)
    // On autosave or when SaveMaster.WriteActiveSaveToDisk() is called
    public string OnSave()
    {
        return JsonUtility.ToJson(stats);
    }

    // In case we don't want to do the save process.
    // We can decide within the script if it is dirty or not, for performance.
    public bool OnSaveCondition()
    {
        return true;
    }
}
```
